# Bike_Sharing
## Purpose: 
  We used Tableau to create visualizations about data from CitiBike in NYC to determine if it might be successful elsewhere.
  Specifically if they would be successful in Des Moines and using August NYC data to represent a high use summer month.
 
## Analysis: 

  We first Determines the number of rides in August in NYC was 2,344,224.

Next we See the breakdown of number of Customers against number of subscribers, shown above.

Above we can see the most poopular pickup and drop off of the bikes. this is important as they will need to be adjusted back regularly and shows where they are being used the most. In this example of NYC we can determine they are used most in high density and touristy areas.

Next, show above is peak usage hours. This shows us when a good time to perform bicycle maintenence and or moving the bikes to other areas for peak times.

The graph above shows what bikes have been used the most and the least. The white in the bottom right represents not many uses and then moving right to left from green to red. Red being the most heavily used bikes. This is also important information for repairs and keeping quality among all bikes similar over time.


In continuing this research I have created a Tableau story that digs further into NYC data primarily regarding user demographics.
